# UI Pattern Project

This project adds JavaScript to building out user interfaces with HTML and CSS.

## UI Pattern

This project utilizes the Hamburger Menu modal. There should be a hamburger icon in the top right corner. When a user clicks on it, a menu should appear from off of the right side of the screen with a list of random image generators. When the user clicks on the each dropdown item, the contents in the center of the page should change to show a series of random images related to that API. The user should be able to see which item is currently selected. The user should be able to close the menu by clicking the hamburger menu again.


## API

Four separate API's were used for four separate random image generators.
